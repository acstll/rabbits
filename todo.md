- write all basic binders except "each" (see rivets)
- 2-way binding: checking 'event' prop on binder, listen to DOM, throttle, calling 'publish'
- keypath parser helper for rivets-like syntax (formatters, computed)
- [OK] parser helper should take a string or an object
- [OK] pass values as dict-object if binder as 'values' array
- special each binder!
